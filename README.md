# Kid's Jukebox
Here you will find all resources I used to build my RFID jukebox project.

The idea is not new. Instead of having CDs scratched in no time or paying ridiculous amounts of money for commercial RFID story players (has anyone ever bought a tonies? Really?), I decided to roll my own.

There are several good ideas for building RFID Jukeboxes out there:

They range from minimal viable products:

To quite sophisticated ones.

I decided the minimum for me would be the following in terms of hardware (all prices indicated are approximately what I paid in 2017, including shipping where applicable)

- Box (Zeller-Holzkisten 30x20x15) - 6,50 EUR - hardware store
    - covers for the sides (I used metal mesh from a beat up IKEA waste paper basket)
    - front (7mm plywood from the hardware store) 
    - some more 1x2 cm wooden slats and some more plywood to mount the internal components
- Speakers, Amp (still had some small active speakers lying around)
- Raspi (still had a v1 lying around)
- Power supply (15W/5V MeanWell, RS-15-5) -  10 EUR - Amazon
- RFID reader (RDM630 UART 125KHz EM4100) - 8 EUR - Amazon
- another RFID reader for provisioning (SODIAL(R) USB RFID DeskTop ID Card Reader) - 5 EUR - Amazon
- 3 Arcade buttons (2 blue, 1 red) -  10 EUR - ebay
- 1 rotary encoder (KY-040 incl. nut) - 3 EUR incl shipping - ebay
- Ground loop insulator (AUKEY) - 10 EUR - Amazon https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01LX0H29W

Also, some small parts

- Ethernet connector (0.3m RJ45 Plug to Jack Panel Mount) - 4 EUR - ebay 
- USB cable (A to L shaped B connector) - 4 EUR - ebay
- ICE Socket C14 Inlet with switch and fuse - 4 EUR - ebay
- Some M3 screws and nuts - 9 EUR - ebay
- Resistors, capacitors - 2 EUR - ebay
- Jumper cable (some shorter, some up to 30 or 40 cm)

No arduino, no display.

However, what fun would it be without an Arduino?

So I scrapped that idea, or rather, I extended it.

So this is what I actually used (in addition to the above):

- Arduino Uno (used to control RFID reader, Buttons, Rotary dial, eventually an LCD) 23 EUR - Amazon
- Proto Shield V5 Prototyping Board f√ºr Arduino Uno - 6 EUR - ebay
- Display (16x2 Zeichen + I2c Modul) - 7 EUR - ebay
- Relais 2-Channel 5V Relais with Optokoppler - 5 EUR - ebay

So, if you tally this up, not exactly cheap. 
Bare bones 75 EUR
Extensions 41 EUR
Total: 116 EUR

And this is without the Raspi, speakers and amp, since I had all of this still lying around...

Add to that maybe 100 hours of research, design, building, programming... But the learning experience was priceless :-)
